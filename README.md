# Do not use this code for malicious purposes, or you'll have a bad time at jail. (not kidding).

# This source is for antivirus developers, or people into malware analysing. 

# Do not try to build your own mrsmajor - that won't work though. The code has been modified in a way so it will not work when it's built into an exe.

# Disclaimer
This program **is not made by me**, the original source code made by rootabx can be found [here](https://github.com/Gork3m/MrsMajor-3.0.git), all the credits go to its respective creator. I rewritten the code in Visual Basic .NET just for fun so I highly recommend you to don't ignore the above warnings.

**Note**: some fragments of the source code are modified for better understanding the code / optimization / bug fixes/ compatibility reasons / etc but the result do exactly the same thing than in the original code.

# New Disclaimer
I downgraded to NetFrameWork3.5 to it works on ReactOS and it works. Also changed code litle bit but it's buggy and I need your help.
Requirements:
https://github.com/itsmattkc/dotnet9x
I'm going to improve too much so it's not only MrsMajor 3.0 modified version.

 **Note 2**: You must run as an administrator. However, I didn't add an admin rights check because it would break compatibility.
